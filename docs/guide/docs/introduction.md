Building bots is a new, exciting challenge for most developers. Creating software that responds in a natural, conversational way to humans is a thrilling new reality.

The challenge is that you (or anyone else) wouldn't want to spend hundreds of hours learning and putting together all the infrastructure and boilerplate code required to get a basic conversational backend up and running.

## What is Botpress

> Botpress is a **lightweight**, **fast**, and **flexible** bot-building platform which can be hosted anywhere whether it be on the cloud or your own servers.

It is a complete platform that ships with all the tools you need to build, deploy, and manage production-grade bots in record time. Here are some of the components that are installed by default:

- An NLU Engine which understands the meaning and intentions behind user statements even where grammatical mistakes exist.
- An administration interface that exposes modules to manage content and show usage statistics, among other things. 
- A visual workflow builder used for building conversations and other interactions.
- A chat emulator/debugger to test conversations and inspect the chatbot engine's logic.
- Support for popular messaging channels like Facebook, Slack, Telegram, and others.

### Why Botpress

Botpress has many advantages over other platforms and frameworks:

- It runs **fully on-prem**, so you can host it on a server of your choice and have full control over the data that comes in and out
- The core of the Botpress platform is **open-source** with thousands of Github contributors and will be free forever.
- The framework is extremely **flexible** and developer-friendly because Botpress can be customized primarily using Javascript with capabilities to include code in other languages.
- **Zero** external dependencies making Botpress the only fully self-contained Bot-Building platform.

## How to build a bot

There are three main steps involved in creating bots.

Developers start by **Building** the bot, which consists of adding the required messaging channels, integrating the necessary backend components and applications your bot will need to interact with, and creating dialog workflows.

Once done, you'll need to **Deploy** the bot somewhere, which could be on a cloud server or your own internal hosting infrastructure.

Finally, you'll give other people access to the bot so they can **Manage** it once it is in use. Managing a bot entails analyzing the conversations, refining the conversational experience by building new flows, and making it smarter by continuously improving the NLU.
